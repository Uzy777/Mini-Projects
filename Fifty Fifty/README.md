enter name
or select from existing name
enter or create unique pincode for validation (so nobody can mess up score idk)
pick T - F
50 50 on right choice which is random.
if right +1 and continue. 
if wrong then game ends and score nothing.
final score if decicde not to play any more is stored to name in text file.

just like a risky game if you want to cintue to climb higher up the ladder or not.
maybe try to implement someone climbing the ladder of each success and then fall when failed.
add sounds aswell for success and fail.
