# Pig Game Project Specification Checklist

## Overview
The Pig Game is a classic dice game where players take turns rolling a die. The aim is to accumulate points and be the first to reach a set target score. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their turn and any points accumulated during that turn. Additionally, a version with two dice introduces a new layer of risk and strategy.
